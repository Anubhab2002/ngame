There is some dirt on it
you should follow before you attend an interview Do remember not to smoke any more otherwise you can t find a job
me I must make good preparations
ime
 you
sume to me and I Ve had the chance to look it over and I must say I m quite impressed
ask me
verview I d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background
d to London when I was quite young at around 16
cated in Europe
om country to country My Father was in the oil business
nturous childhood
lutely We were never still for too long But now I m really looking to settle down
ell let s move on to discuss your education shall we
ure
t on a date last night didnt you
te for the first time
come
now
 dont you phone her for a date again
 walk out on me
e bright side try to make another date again
s for your advice
s bus is supposed to go
ake us all the way up to Altadena
u know
 not
ht bus or not
ht one
re are we This is not Altadena
 been on the bus forever
ns say
h that one says Temple City
ook for the bus myself
e us back
hibition booth The client thinks its too dark and they want to add halogen lighting Weve already got 3 sets of track lighting from you guys do you think you could help us out and throw in some halogens
ogen lighting is much more expensive than your track lighting system Plus Im going to have to call in some guys to install it for you Thats not going to come cheap
ure Were not talking about anything new here
we will still have to call the electrician out and they are union labor Itll cost you a pretty penny
 do you think it would cost
 I estimate itll run in the neighborhood of 500 per light
ly be that expansive
 lights take more electricity so your electrical cost is going to be higher as well
 blow so much more on halogens
he cost and thats what its going to cost us We cant go in the hole with this I am giving you my best price so take it or leave it
 you see May today
y does she have such a long face
the foggiest idea
be happy
e she got a promotion recently
t s some kind of personal problem
 you look so depressed today Mike
ible quarrel with my neighbor yesterday
 come
le I didnt
is misunderstood But why not take it easy
nice of you to comfort me
anyone need a drink
 take one Hows the cooler situation
 arecheers
guys didnt drive did you
d us to carry some stuff home later
ing theres a lot of drunk driving
 show Today I am going to show you how to make the perfect mouthwatering sandwich Are you ready Let s get started
or oven or grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color
o the perfect sandwich I would strongly recommend you put fresh vegetables in your sandwich
oil
ne mustard sauce mayonnaise ketchup or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor It s always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt
 time we have for today but join us next time where we ll be going over how to make the perfect lasagna Till next time

they are often used to find illegal drugs and bombs by the police and customs officers

 stocks then
nvestment If I choose a good stock and hold it long enough I can get good returns
o effect shipment during September
e can
when is the earliest we can expect shipment
ddle of October I think
 and our Customs formalities are rather complicated
derstand
he red tape involved take at least a couple of weeks Thus after shipment it will be four to five weeks altogether before the goods can reach our retailers The goods must therefore be shipped before October otherwise we wont be in time for the selling season
ries are fully committed for the third quarter In fact many of our clients are placing orders for delivery in the fourth quarter
 us If we place our goods on the market at a time when all other importers have already sold their goods at profitable prices we shall lose out
 say that we cannot advance the time of delivery
 bad but I sincerely hope you will give our request your special consideration
hat the last thing we want to do is to disappoint an old customer like you But the fact remains that our manufacturers have a heavy backlog on their hands
fort please A timely delivery means a lot to us

 s appetite
 on table manners while I was in the United States Some of the things we learnt included how to place the napkin and utensils and how to pass the bread Before each course the teacher would ask if we wanted to learn the Continental European way or the American way We always said “ American way ” It s amazing that everyone is so used to their own table manners What is the Chinese way
f the same plate I assume it is less complicated right
e table so food won t drop on their cloths No noise should be made when chewing No one should move food back to the communal plate even if he doesn t like it One should drink soup slowly and is not supposed to make a lot of noise All these table manners are very similar to Western habits
 of etiquette regardless of their background Apart from the different tools used for eating we seem to follow the same principles We do not let inappropriate manners spoil other people s appetiteWesterners like to say “ bon appetite ” before meals which is one way to suggest “ mind your table manners ” Is there such an expression in Chinese

But it has already past The traffic from the airport to downtown has been relieved after the completion of Yanan Aerial Road
i is such a big metropolis same as New York city David would it be a good idea to rent a car here Ive got an international drivers license with a pretty good record in the States
l OK Ill remember that But I have to warn you that you must drive very carefully in the downtown area for therere no separate lanes for motor vehicles and bicycles in some places and still quite a few people dont take road regulations seriously
 up
much Last night I met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time that we decided to meet again tonight
exciting Whats this guy like Is he hot
e Chinese food I have the feeling that we are going to be great friends
do you look for in a friend
t when I first meet somebody I can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend It seems I have a radar helping me spot new friends

ionship with a dishonest person Those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need

 My name is Richard Clarke and I am joined today by the very erudite DavidWatson
ou Dick Today we are going to talk about the movie Lion King Tell me Dave what is your impression of this film
ntriesThe musical score was amazing the animation was very well done and the story was simply enchanting
ven though the animation was technically strong and as you say the score and songs performed by Elton John were great the film lacks a certain originality it lacked heart And I would dare to say it was too predictable
t s not a thriller
s For example when Mufasal dies or the dark grim portrayal of Scar Even so the film is linear Mufasal dies Simba runs away thinking it s his fault Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his It s just too cliche
lue of respect life and love
 always been so soft Dave

e to Without her support and encouragement I dont think I would have felt confident enough to have written up a proposal suggesting that the department change a process that had been in place for a long time But she was open to suggestions so long as employees could back them up with research and facts When I submitted my suggestion she reviewed it and told me where she thought it needed more work She then took my revised proposal to her boss He was a more conservative type but she lobbied him to try It for several weeks He did and it was so successful that it was instituted as a permanent change Ive also worked for some very difficult bosses in summer and parttime jobs And while Id certainly prefer to work for one like Ive just described Im the kind of person who can get along with just about anyone

 anything at least not to begin with

u refuse us the agency

 I m done working for a company that is taking me nowhere
nna do Just quit
 up a business plan get some investors and start working for myself
you ever written up a business plan before
ss how you are going to do things and that s it right
ive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has history etc
t seems easy enough
y are different from competitors Then comes the hard part a market analysis You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea
 Is that all
 to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment
 trying to start up a business
Id like to remind you that we must be aware of the threat we face

ed the waiter
All right Lets go back to school
nes shall we now discuss the packaging
finite ways of packaging garments As to blouses we use a polythene wrapper for each article all ready for window display
h the sales With competition from similar garments producers the merchandise must not only be good value but also look attractive
the blouses appeal to the eye as well as to the purse
ut the outer packing
ne carton gross weight around 25 kilos a carton
tons
rd boxes
es instead
wooden cases
xes are not strong enough for such a heavy load
dle They wont be stowed away with the heavy cargo The stevedores will see to that Besides well reinforce the cartons with straps Silk blouses are not fragile goods They can stand a lot of jolting
ndon If the boxes are moved about on an open wharf the dampness or rain may get into them This would make the blouses spotted or ruined
 are made of cardboard they will be handled with care
the risk of pilferage
g with cartons is easily detected I should say that this rather discourages pilferage
unsuitable for sea voyage
ch packing for W P A and T P N D
 would be quite willing to accept cartons
n any responsibility that is beyond our functions and powers Well make sure that the packing is seaworthy but we cant commit ourselves to being responsible for every kind of mishap
 Im asking too much
if you insist but the charge for packing will be considerably higher and it also slows delivery
ately for instructions on the matter
e do Ill be waiting for your reply

k of the way people use and treat animals
but we are often cruel to animals When we raise animals for food the conditions they live in are often poor
ating animals We could grow more crops
u do with all the animals You couldn t just let them go Besides some people would still hunt them Meat has become an integral part of our diet
ter conditions anyway We should certainly try to improve the conditions at zoos We should try to recreate the natural conditions as much as possible
I think it s good for kids to see wild animals
in other ways
 are being introduced
their pets well
 you read about people who have been cruel to pets or other animals but those stories are rare

ferent from Western chess
 Playing chess is a very aggressive experience All the pieces are supposed to capture their opponents Whenever I start a chess game I cant help but imagine a concrete battle in which all fighters stand ready to kill
th wiki
surround a larger area than the opponent In other words each side is struggling for a greater living space by mapping out a territory on the board Hence chess aims to kill while weigh is most concerned with howso survive

 man
Have you got a sec I have some questions about my paycheck
ily Pull up a chair
dont understand First of all what is this FICA and SUI Y tax and why are there deductions both for Medicare and for my health insurance plan
 your pay stub This number here represents your gross pay
ire or if you were unable to work
Medicare isnt actually a health insurance I can use now
y fund that our state has set up but you can see its a pretty small quantity that they take
mind giving them a dollar fifty for that So there are two separate income taxes — one at a state level and one at a federal level
property taxes or sales taxes instead
se I can figure out on my own The deductions for health insurance and my 401 K are pretty selfexplanatory Thanks for your help Susan
blem All those deductions do add up and nobodys net pay is as high as theyd like I can understand why youd want some explanation

ever had anything stolen
why
cle just had his motorcycle stolen a few nights ago I was just thinking about how clever criminals are these days
als are clever They re only successful when people are careless
 s motorcycle were pretty good
ncle had an alarm system then it wouldn t have happened
et too
yone stop them
 motorcycle was being stolen The thieves came in a truck and convinced everybody that my uncle was parked illegally and they were there to tow it away
criminals aren t that dumb after all
 the end They were so good that they convinced a bystander to help them lift the motorcycle and put it in the truck

lad to tell that we have successfully registered the trademark for our new product It is the time to think of some effective promoting strategies We are beginning to get more attention from overseas
 for our promotion for our Iseries
new to some consumers Maybe we should start our advertising program with our local and overseas distributors simultaneously because they stand on a better position for selecting the best ways to advertise in market places Besides the advertisement fund can encourage them to spend more attention on advertising our products
good approach for advertising
tisement company I can get help and inspiration from him And we can also try some less expensive approaches of advertising such as online sales Personally I prefer to the online sales for it is cheaper faster and wider

bling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the intentional exploitation of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain It disgusts me
are you talking about How does it exploit people
milies and bankrupts communities Once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop People have lost their houses cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted Secondly it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk Women gamble to escape and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction Underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal bookies
 a good idea Although I have been to Las Vegas and I didn t become addicted or anything like that

ks I didnt expect the dish to be so spicy Are you ok
ugh its a little salty for me But you are Chinese you should have known better
not every Chinese can handle spicy food in the way people from Sichuan and Guizhou provinces can Back where I come from people dont eat a lot of papers and chilies
ed in Sichuan for a year The food was difficult at the beginning Every dish was so spicy After a while though I got used to the taste and now I wont consider anything a real dish if it isnt spicy
olerance for spicy food but so far I havent had the need or the opportunity Every time I try spicy food it is a total disaster for my nose and eyes
idnt intend on liking spicy food at first either but when you have no other choices youve got to adapt

movies tonight
s playing
ew Twilight movie
 the vampire movies No way I am watching that but I don t understand why everyone is so excited about these films about vampires It doesn t make sense
e a modern tale of Romeo and Juliet You can see a couple who are in love but can t be together because they are so different And in the fact that immortality and super human strengthen this really sexy and there you have it Plus the cast is hip young people that make the movie even more enticing
buy into that I think it s just a fad Pretty soon this will pass and everyone will be into wearwolves or zombies

hips and boats are no longer so important in transportation as they used to be
ats have been giving place to trains planes and automobiles
business and the liners up and down the Yangtze River have been reduced by 70
 of people is now getting faster and faster so the speed of ships and boats seems to be so slow I think it may be the reason why people dont like to travel by boat
 the most of the transoceanic cargo transportation is still carried by boat

my business to keep up with events in China
time
s a good idea
ress code I still think people would wear formal clothing to work
nt to wear what they feel most comfortable in
sitions but I think the marketing and sales staff would definitely not agree They dress for success You cant go out on a sales call if you are dressed in jeans Its just not respectful to you client
ed I would rather have a downtoearth honest and solid sales person than a painted patent leather designer suite salesman
ple judge you by your appearance whether you like it or not So dressing professional is being professional The image that you portray to others is so important in business Its your image and how others perceive you that makes the difference between landing or losing a sale

me to my shop next time
 a problem Id like if possible to see it settled at this meeting
 is it Mrs Wang
 about 20 of them were moldy and in many cartons there were even small brownish bugs crawling in and out of the half eaten mushrooms We cant accept them in this state They are unfit for human consumption And the Medical Officer of Health has issued a Stop Notice on them
 your lot was found moldy and wormeaten Have you any evidence
 absolutely reliable
surveyors have not mentioned any cause for the damage
urvey are all sound and intact So it is obvious the cause of the damage is that the mushrooms were not completely dried before packing
ureau inspected the goods in question They concluded that the goods were well dehydrated from fresh and choice material and up to standard for export
 their attention As the amount in question is only 20 of the whole shipment I think it is only reasonable that you should compensate us for the loss
nsation for loss incurred in transit because you bought the goods F O B Houston and on shipping quality not on landed quality Your claim in our opinion should be referred to the insurance company as the mishap occurred after shipment
ong sea voyage
a matter over which we could exercise no control then Im afraid I have to insist that you approach the insurance company for settlement that is if you have covered this risk in your coverage
tunate oversight on our part and a lesson to us
r case
s well have to waive the claim
imming pool here

o you think will emerge with the last laugh in this World Cup
 in a very good conditions
t think group A consists of Austria China and Saudi Arabia all of which are minnows
 as six times Oh my goodness Im afraid the team is under a spell
od ability to control the midfield They recorded a total of 62 tackles in the match against Austria And they to be endowed with perfect positional sense I think that will give rise to scoring chances sooner or later
vements to the right attacking positions and through accurate welltimed passes
l have very high hopes for the team Now that the tournament has proceeded into the knockout stage the Germans will probably make it through to the finals
ation for their tenacity and discipline especially in vital decisive encounters

incoln Bank What can we do for you
ng full advantage of it
certainly are many benefits that go along with our credit card
ts so much easier than cash to be honest nowadays I hardly ever use cash I just put it on the card and pay off the balance every month
n full every month
eally
nd statement the amount in full but also the minimum payment
was having a bad month and spent a little too much I could just pay the minimum
long as you keep making regular monthly payments paying the minimum is just fine Of course your credit limit will be lowered accordingly
ow so
is 5000 RIB and you owe 1000 RIB your available credit will be 4000 RIB So your credit limit drops
 see Well I dont plan on only paying the minimum but its good to know that I can if I had to Thanks for that

any way we can get central air conditioning in this building
mplete system
use the separate units I guess
l and the new units really are very quietYour customers wont even notice them
dollars
d probably be another 700 to 1000 dollarsBut it depends on the time spent of course
prised
s just for the units
y usually installs the things they sellThey dont charge extra
am But they would just raise the price of the units to cover their costsHere in L A installation is charged separately
 than 6000 dollars for thisWe havent even opened yet
 Maam
 do it for 4000 dollars
 not get good equipment Ive been in this business for almost twenty years I know what happensIf you dont get quality air conditioning now you will just have to replace the system after two years

ou out at all
ng over to my bosshouse for dinner tonight and dont know what kind of wine I should bring
ll be served
good sushi
riously difficult to pair with wine Well lets see have to be a white wine of course
well with sushi
d a white wine which has more subtle flavors to complement the fish
Thats a white wine right
est bet Chardonnay is one of the more fullbodied whites and tends to be a bit oaky Id suggest that you go for something brighter like this Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand
vignon Blanc Whats that
al or type of grape just like Chardonnay
e dinner now
 lovely
tal is that
s specify the varietal on the label The French believe that the soil a grape is grown in is one of the most important factors in the final flavor of the wine This wine is probably a blend of a few different types of grapes mostly Viognier Id guess
ine
nc we were looking at earlier which means its more approachable Its light and crisp with a bit of a vanilla aroma

ht well take it
y good sir Will you register please
K
how you to your room
 great invention but one of the main criticisms of it is that people just arent selective enough Lesley got a television how do you pick out the sorts ofprogrammes you want to watch
that are on to decide which particular ones interest me rather than you turning it on a seven oclock and you leaving it on until halfpast eleven when the programmes finish
a great timewaster
ring what it is theyre watching
nto your life and taking oversour evenings and at the same time perhaps get get out of thetelevision some of the sort of best things best programmes that that undoubtedly are on television
l I suppose one of the problems is will depend on what a persons life style is and that if he has other outside interests which are equally important to him as television he will then you know hmm be more careful about which programme she wants to watch because he has time which he wants to use for other things
ored all they do is justturn on the television
levision will be the main thing in the room

e difference between the Board of Directors the CEO and the stockholders They all seems ot be the same group of people to me
e boss If there is only one person with absolute power in the organization everyone knows that the power will go to their head Its too dangerous Thats the reason for a Board of Directors The board is made up of people who are experts in the industry They could be related to the organization but more commonly they are independent and nonbiased
people are on the board of directors
